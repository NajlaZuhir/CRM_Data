A separate section in this house talks about the recent redevelopment of the area which has been done in a way that combines the best of old and new with a particular focus on improved sustainability.Getting to the museums from the Msheireb metro station is easy - about a 450m walk along shaded roads (part of the sustainability drive)- although as we often find in Doha, there is not a lot of signage so one is reliant on a phone or a passerby to locate the museums. Entry is free, there is an app which can be downloaded with all the info but donâ€™t expect to be given any sort of printed information!! There seem to be plenty of cafe options nearby but these are all very high-end so although the museum visit is free, and the metro cheap, one could still end up spending big.",,3

The museums stress the darker aspects of the Qatar experience - the struggles, the poverty, the heat. But the slavery museum is something else - it is strange as it is self-critical, and it doesn't really make sense that this is a government museum criticizing government policies (or at least policies condoned by the government), but maybe one can frame it as a first, very slick step. Very interesting the post-colonial perspective with similar blame for the West etc. Very educational; great dedicated staff throughout. It may hurt, but you should do that to yourself.",,6

Having previously used libraryâ€™s worldwide- it is bit confusing and might require some time until you completely understand how you can locate the book. Ever since opening/ they have reduced the number of books can be taken per child and per adult. The childrenâ€™s library also has gone through some changes and the play area as well as soft play area has been removed- which is bit disappointing as kids used to like it. Also at the lobby there used to be cafe- just beside the auditorium it has also been removed - I hope that they will reopen . They have small canteen nearby the children library- which serves fresh food - good quality and great prices . I have gone also today to return some books- as unfortunately during Ramadan their timing is 9am to 4 pm. Therefore that means that I canâ€™t take kids to library and people are working at least till 2-3 pm- I hope next year they change the timings- as people can work in shifts- and there are non Muslim employees- and I think opening from lunch till evening would be much better.Itâ€™s nice place to come- just one thing for sure due to distance- and that it is at the corner of gharafa- you wonâ€™t be visiting it too often - therefore take maximum books- and you have an option to extend their return twice online .,,6

I was excited to see all the colours and people from different countries celebrating the Asia football tournament. It just happened that Jordan had won that day and Jordanians were dancing and singing in the open courtyard. I went around buying traditional clothes and souvenirs for my family and friends back home. Some jewellery for my granddaughters. Middle Eastern spices and sweets too. If you get tired or hungry, no worries. Ther are dosens of cafes and earteries of different cusines and nationatlities. The food and seating is very good. The art ally was an OMG! I have to dedicate a whole day for it again. The artists were not in at that time. I need to spend more time there. On our way out I had to go back to some other shops I missed seeing and bought some more stuff (I couldnâ€™t help it!). You will also pass by the Thump, which is a public art piece by acclaimed French artist CÃ©sar Baldaccini at the heart of Souq Waqif to mark the biggest sporting success in Qatarâ€™s history.But the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of the tour was the Qatari traditional dancing of the men with their shinny swords and beautiful hand grips. They were also training some young boys of different ages to learn how to dance with their smaller swords.  Donâ€™t miss going there, what are you waiting for!",,0

Besides, there is one famous regular customer talk guy in his end of twenies khaled in January 2020 who was a frequent customer and comes to take pictures disturbing us customers by moving around the shop creating noises. What surprised me is that khaled is not a Kava owner and he standing in the cashier whom I thought he works there just like in Bahrain and asked for coffee. This guy with his biligerant attitude rolled his eyes in Kava coffee. Walked away and hiss by blaming the door. The 3 Filipino staff witnessed this incident. I was offended and get gobsmacked. I spoken to the owner ahmed of kavs but he was defensive and valued his own friends and circles by treating khaled tall white skin guy and thin which was totally unacceptable for customer to stand on the cashier. This would never happen back in country. What is more is that some locals in Qatar are entitled do what ever they want and act in entitled manner. As I come from Bahrain I didn't like that attitude. Another coffee shop i coffee shop over the counter is extremely expensive and it does not that awesome because chocolate and coffee are not compatible with each other and it caused me acidity for 3 days. I have given a feedback to owner and she didn't apologize nor gave a refund. She insisted she targeting the local marker. An excuse and she was rude. I was evening taking photo of my own coffee one local lady approached me and accused me. When she knew I was from Bahrain they acted differently towards me and showed her my phone I didnt take picture of her sister innocent took place between January and February 2020. Local owners give free away coffee to their own people and for others. They even do not have a loyalty programmes. Be aware of Khalid and Mohamed those regular drama queen customers in town. They are so scary. I believe if there is an issues owners there must compensate and give refund. I was so disappointed and they involved into politics because I gave my own opinion and they were crosses.",,1

We find ourselves coming here frequently to meet friends or special events. The winter is the best time to go but during the warmer months it is still nice with many air conditioned areas. The promenade is nice to walk around and it is worthwhile to look at the events board to see upcoming activities in the area. Quite a few of the shops and exhibits are free to enter but make sure you ask first.Getting there is easy with the Katara metro station that has an entrance by Galeries Lafayette and it is between The Pearl and West Bay on the sea front. It can get windy at night so you may want to bring a sweater at night in the cooler months. Covering up your shoulders and knees feels appropriate in this area because many Qataris and Arabic people will wear their formal wear in the area. Cars and golf carts have the right away so be careful when walking around.,,2

Parking was quite easy, as it was still early (11am). Easy walking access to the beach on boardwalk numbered gates. After 5 mins, I was approached by a uniformed security guard that very politely and clearly explained that I needed a ticket and wristband to walk along the beach. He kindly escorted me to the pay kiosk and I paid the requested 10QAR for my ticket. I was offered a sunshade and chairs at an extra 10QAR, but I declined as I just wanted to walk and soak up some mud morning sun. There were no restrictions imposed and no signage nor barriers preventing access to any of the beachfront as I walked along. I was soon approached by another uniformed security guard that told me it wasn’t allowed to walk along the beach as it was closed (I was moderately dressed in knee length shorts and capped sleeved T-shirt). I explained that had just paid and showed him my ticket and wristband and I asked him why it wasn’t allowed… suddenly he didn’t speak or understand English. He then let me pass. As I continued walking along the waterfront beach (away from the busy family area), I was approached by another uniformed security guard… there were plenty about! He also told me that the section of beach I was walking on was closed and I couldn’t proceed. Please note there was no signs nor barriers anywhere stating what parts are open / closed. The 3rd guard explained that the beach was unsafe because they were working on preparing it for opening in the next few days. The beachfront was no different to the busy family area and there were no tools, equipment or signs of any construction preparation… and no workers, because it was Friday.. this part of the beach was EMPTY. By now I had removed my T-shirt as I turned and made my way back down to the beachfront when I was stopped by another 3 security guards (that’s 6 so far if you’re keeping count). He told me to leave the beach via number 12 boardwalk and re-enter at #9, he also said that I was no longer on the beach (but walking adjacent to it) that I had to put my T-shirt back on. Another security guard intervened and told me that it was ok to leave my shirt off, as the walk was less than 50m to re-enter the beachfront. With the World Cup less than 20 days away, I would advise the following actions are in place to ensure there are no problems with the 000’s of foreign tourists expected in Qatar. 1) Clear multi-lingual / pictorial signage to advise patrons of what is and what isn’t allowed on katara beach. 2) Trained security teams that can speak and understand English language, and have been briefed on any non-accessible areas.3) Clear pricing information on the website.",,4

However we visited just prior to the World Cup and there was a lot of activity going on and much of the attractions were closed. It is free to enter and despite there being little to see close up it is still a good place to wander around.The Amphitheater is impressive affording great views across the bay. You can easily wander around and wheelchair access is possible. There is a very large promenade to walk along before going into little side streets which try to make you feel you’re deep within a village or town. Only the numerous golf buggies zipping around give it away. Plenty of cafes around the central square with air conditioning rising through ornate street vents. Best to go after 4pm. Will definitely be worth a visit once fully open.,,0

So if you want to visit Grand Mosque always search ""Imam Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahab Mosque"" than you will get the right location.The distance of National Mosque is 3.7 km from West Bay and 8.1 km from Old Doha/ Souq Waqif.The Mosque was opened in 2011, having 90 domes and 1 Minaret with total capacity of 30,000 peoples. The National Mosque is the largest Mosque of Qatar.This is one of the beautiful Mosque i have ever seen with eye catching architecture that have several entrance gates for gents, ladies, disabled person and have large parking area.The best time to visit Mosque is Evening or blue hours to enjoy the lighting of the mosque.The security persons will allow you only to take pictures from mobile they won't allow you to take pictures with Professional Camera (DSLR) without prior approval from qatar authorities that was very disappointed for me because i walked too long just to take pictures with my camera.Muslims and non-Muslims both can visit the Mosque any time with proper dress code, ladies must wear Abaya and cover their heads.If you take a taxi to the mosque either you can ask driver to wait for you or you can walk around 300 to 500 meters to reach at Main street from where you can get another taxi.If you are in Qatar must visit this place.",,1

I especially liked the grass and vegetation here, a nice change from the vast desert that surrounds Doha. Our main reason for coming was to see Richard Serra's sculpture, ""7,"" which looms at the end of the MIA Park Pier. Made from seven steel plates, each rises for 78 feet. A big fan of Serra's work, I feared I might not get up close and personal with this creation, because my husband was having mobility problems and was ready to turn back. But a park employee driving a golf cart stopped and offered us a ride to see the piece. The carts are available for moving disabled pedestrians around the park.The expanse is a lovely place for a respite after visiting the museum. There are places to buy food and bicycles to rent.

Villagio mall is one of my favourite malls due to its incredible variety of amenities and fascinating staff with very unique characteristics. However, today I have experienced a concerning misconception and I am extremely unsatisfied with the following: I went out shopping and bought a sufficient amount of items for my needs, after that, I felt quiet hungry. So, I went and ordered popcorn and nachos from Cineco cinema’s snack kiosk. I would like to say that I am absolutely unhappy by the staff’s service. I have ordered a mix of cheese and caramel popcorn, the worker has had a misunderstanding and thought I said salt and caramel; he then proceeded and gave me a mix of caramel and salt, I then told him that I would like to have cheese and caramel not salt and caramel… He then gave me an impolite response of, “you made me get you salt and caramel, here it is”, I told him that I actually wanted cheese and caramel, but he insisted I was wrong and kept giving me ill- mannered replies. I am extremely dissatisfied and I will not be recommending Cineco to anyone I know, this is a disgraceful situation that is extremely unnecessary. I hate that it that I’m here writing a negative review but I wouldn’t like anyone to go through a similar place like mine. I do not recommend this place for anyone looking up to visit and I encourage you try other alternatives.  This event took place on Saturday 22nd of October 2022.",,2

There is incorrect Information given to you and you end up paying more. Let alone, your money is expired in the card in case you are unable to renew the card (there is no one year grace period in case it was told by one of their staff).  Money is deducted from defective rides too and nothing is done about it. No compensation whatsoever.  Some rides are under repair (which defeats the purpose of your trip since you are not told which ones are not working before making a payment) .  Trampolines are FILTHY and not sanitised.

The stadium itself is pretty nice and the queues to enter, although long, were relatively fast. There are, however, some points that put it not up to the best stadiums in the world IMHO.First of all, it's also an athletics stadium, which automatically means that the crowd is nowhere near the pitch, which in turn impacts the atmosphere. Acoustics seem nice though, as we could hear fans singing throughout the matches. Chairs are comfortable enough, but why would someone choose to install fixed type chairs in a ""revamped"" stadium is beyond my comprehension, as they allow less space for people to move to and from their seats. Bars are also not up to the game, food and beverage options are scarce and they only take cash.Both games were at night time, so I can't really comment on whether the air conditioning would work on a hot summer afternoon, but it definitely looks like it can handle.Most reviews criticizing the logistics to and from the stadium were from before the metro was ready. Now there's a station right in front of it and even after the game, with 40k people's leaving the stadium, it was not an issue. Plus a shopping mall a few minutes walking from it offers several nice pre-match meal opportunities.",,2

Thank you to all staffs at Quest.I must say I have been to multiple theme parks in my life at various parts of the world and Doha Quest is definitely on my top 3.From the time I arrived I was greeted warmly by the staffs and was given an exciting introduction to the theme park. My first impression was “Wow this place is so clean and beautiful!” On top of that, the background music played throughout my visit was so comfortable to my ears which added so much joy to the ambiance. In a nutshell, the park consist of 3 different themes: The past, the present and the future. The entrance is very affordable (QAR225) since I spent half a day there. I started my journey from the past and ended at the future. Although I must say the transition between the parks were not easy to notice but it doesnt really matter when you are there.They have 2 Guinness world book of record rides which I had a chance to try. Super thrilling! I wont say it here because you have to try it on your own. The park offfers more than 30 other rides to play for both young and older visitors. Some rides were above my expectation really. Very high tech.Queues were well managed. Even though I had some kids trying to cut my line, the staffs were super attentive to nicely tell them (the kids) about the line and avoided any dissatisfaction from others queuing.We dined at Planet Hollywood mid our visit which was very pleasant too. Food was delicious and staffs were so easy to talk to.10 out of 10 experience for me ! Definitely will return if there are more new thrilling rides and I highly recommend to all tourist and residents in Qatar to try!",,5

Excellent choice of stands and general admission spaces to get a good view of the cars. Good space for fans around the edge of the main grandstands. Walkways to each area are well made and can take huge capacity. Surprisingly easy to get out when a big event comes to an end too. Big well made car parks with clear sections marked out and very accessible by their superior roads. The metro stop nearest to the circuit is a bit away and does require a taxi or shuttle bus. Toilet facilities are very well done and are well spaced out for each stand area. Excellent organisation and staffing. Everything ran like clockwork. I do wish I had known the fireworks were at the back of the circuit as I couldn’t see them very much from the T2 corner stand. You need to move round to the other side really.,,4

You can also travel to Lusail  Metro and take shuttle bus on race days. This was first F1 race in Qatar so nearly 80,000 fans and probably biggest race in its history so lots of road congestion and not great traffic planning (with constant hold ups to let through local VIP security convoys). Leave plenty of time by car for big events but plenty of parking around site, Not all stands have great views (North stand set back  for some inexplicable reason from main stand do you can’t see main straight/start/finish where these is probably the most overtaking). Facilities pretty good but not on the scale of European circuits. Fully floodlit circuit does look impressive at night and this is a very high speed circuit so looks good for drivers. Lots of big screens around circuit and spectator areas to follow all the action. On exit main exit gates only partially open effectively funnelling crowd through small exit..very poor operation from a safety and covid viewpoint. No strict checking of health app on entry either (neither on qualifying day apparently).

There were plenty of available seats the whole weekend. In saying this those we pre-purchased their tickets had to pick them up from an office which is a long walk or (10min) drive from the entrance. Please be aware that you can buy tickets at the entrance. If you are lucky you could probably get a local selling one for a cheaper price in front of the ticket office.There were two large screens which made viewing the circuit comfortable. Lots of the seats out front of the pits were full but apart from that plenty of leg room.The food at the circuit is limited to fast food i.e. pizza, burgers, coffee etc. There was only 6 vendors at the track and of course all food prices were inflated.The toilets were good although not all were open so just beware of the distance needed to be walked to get to the facilities.They had a display of bikes and cars available to view. They also only had one merchandise shop which had run out half of its stock by the Saturday.In terms of transport to the venue we took metered taxi's as they were the cheapest around 60-80 Riyali from The Ramada Encore Hotel (City Centre).Getting home from the venue the taxi rank was large. We decided to walk towards the exit road of which if you keep your arm up you will eventually get an unmetered/private taxi. The cost for using them was 100 Riyali. This was worth the cost compared with waiting in the large taxi line.If you are looking at hiring a car, go for it! There is plenty of parking at the venue and they are quite sensible in how they drive.Our accommodation was the Ramada Encore Doha. This was the perfect hotel for us. Conveniently located to main roads (easy to get to and from track), there are local restaurants and mini-marts around the corner, it was a short walk to the Souq Waqif (Tourist area) and they had a 24hr pool which was nice to relax in!The taxi fare to and from the airport was no more than 50 Riyali.",,4

All throughout the weekend we had views of all the riders in their garages and on race day were able to see them only 20m away on the starting grid! The staff around the place were pleasant and although there is only three food outlets and one place to buy merchandise as the spectator attendance is the lowest in the Moto GP racing year there wasn't queues or crowds. I feel that they could open up a walkway around the track as you can only view the racing from the start/finish line and when there for the whole weekend I'd liked to have walked around the track to see the bikes form different angles and take better photographs. However if you are a Moto GP fan who would like to see the riders in their garage and have a guaranteed seat with a podium view this is the track for you.",,5

Being a big blue and white ""bubble"" it stands out a bit in the desert and you can see the masses of floodlights for the track next to it. People have commented on poor facilities but by facilities I mean toilets (which are the cleanest and most plentiful compared to any other track I've been to), the seating (which is spacious, plentiful and kept as clean as possible given the desert location) and the big screens (you can see one fairly clearly from every seat). I therefore think it is the shortage of catering and retail facilities people are complaining about.  I admit there are only a few catering stalls but everything has been excellent, not too expensive and the area kept exceptionally clean. My only disappointment is that there wee no track t-shirts for sale.

Any request to the staff fell on deaf ears, the manager didnt even come and speak to us to explain why the drinks were unavailable.Gourmet dinner provided........thats a laugh! tinned spaghetti bolognese LOL!

I found the display of recent Qatari history (monarchy transitions, boycotts etc.) very honest utc and well done indeed, seeing that this is a National Museum after all - certainly more honest than the British Museum, but that's ofc a low threshold.  Of the collection pieces, the Pearl Carpet of Baroda with 1.5 million Basra pearls (recently bought from Sotheby's for a low $5.5 million) stood out.But for now and until January 2022, I would strongly recommend the Pipilotti Rist installation at the end of the tour. As it is kind of together with the exit to the Old Palace (which I found underwhelming but the courtyard around it is nice), it is easily missed, but this is really a great, immersive light installation. The theory around it is a bit naff, but one can easily ignore that - and I was surprised to see later on the website that one's supposed not to use one's gadgets. Clearly for most people today, and also given the Qatari culture, this is an Instagram place first of all - but it is also great to just sit there and see the effects go off. Very nice!The gift shop is good but not as good as those in other Doha museums. The cafe seemed uninviting, the restaurant was closed. None of this is a problem, but I just mention it for planning purposes. 100 riel is a stiff price.

I would say that really this museum is indispensable on a trip to Qatar as it offers such an insight into a country that is more than just an oil republic - this museum helps to showcase that.

Behind the walking area with stone slabs of different colours, forming patterns, is in parts a lawn with palm trees, where especially on Fridays people meet and sit around. Most of them being young expats working here, the greatest number probably from countries of the Indian peninsula.In this part is also the Pearl Monument, a popular photo spot, and the fountain with a sculpture of traditional water pots. From here one has great views across the bay towards the impressive skyline of high rises in the new business district of West Bay.Hardly a coastal city on the Arabian peninsula is without its 'Corniche'. There are several in Saudi-Arabia and the UAE, there is Matrah Corniche near Muskat, Oman and also Kuwait City has its corniche. The word comes from the French Riviera, where there still is the most famous Corniche of all, originally meaning a road between see and mountain, derived from the Italian word 'cornice' (cliff). From here the expression travelled to Egypt and Beirut, then the Arabian peninsula, meaning a passage by a waterfront, something which otherwise is usually called an 'Esplanade' or 'Promenade'.",,6

Oggled at by entire staff during payment dispute caused by museum.,Friends,"Rude, incompetent manager and bizarre behavior.Paying customers refused entry as a result of the museums failed booking system.The manager decided that it was somehow our fault that their booking system failed and began blaming us for not calling their 3rd party payment provider before arrival.Kept repeating that it was ""not their issue"" because it was the booking system that failed, refusing to admit any responsibility for the payment partner they decide to use for their business.Money was taken from our account and the manager was refusing to even contact their provider or offer any sort of solution or even a passing apology.Not once did the manager say 'sorry' or offer to help rectify the problem caused by the business he supposedly manages. Instead kept insisting that we call our bank and get a refund that way and request we pay again for access to the museum.The strangest part of all this, is after about 10 minutes of this incompetent manager flinging blame at his paying customers, I realised that about 8 staff members had ammased around us, talking and giggling like school children. This made us extremely uncomfortable and is totally bizarre for 8 people to watch their manager insult 3 paying customers.We would have been happy to pay again for entry had the manager said anything close to ""Sorry, this is an issue with a 3rd party, I will ensure you get a refund for the failed booking, if you could pay in cash now, we can grant you access."" But after being blamed constantly, told that this is our fault and being oggled at by their entire staff we ended up leaving, without a refund and without any sort of apology.I have never experienced a more rude and incompetent manager in my life, and I am shocked he has employment to be completely honest. We we're civil the entire time, so to be treated so poorly is shocking and disappointing. We understand that digital systems can mess up, that was never the problem. Being treated like they didn't want us there is a big problem and is the reason for this review.I guess we'll have to do his job for him and contact our bank to get our money back from this business.Terrible, inexcusable experience.",,4

We were a group of 4 and purchased our tickets at the entrance desk where we met Diana. She had an unpleasant attitude right from the start, condensingly taking our payment and volunteering to take us around and explain the illusions, which she did in an impatient rude manner. She volunteered to take our pictures, something we didn't ask of her and started off by allowing to use two different phones, along the way she told us one phone was enough and closer to the end she balantly refused to take anymore pictures, in her words, its not my obligation, I am not required to help you, I was only assisting you. This was confusing to us since we didn't ask for her assistance at the beginning. We patiently listened to her impatient explanations and accommodated her dismissive body language because we wanted to enjoy the experience, but it ended up mostly not being enjoyable. The museum has cool illusions, but we found a guide is required to explain them. The text on the illusions was not the easiest to understand in comparison to explanation from a person. I would recommend the experience and hope you have a better and professional guide, if a guide is part of the fee that is.",,1

Only the guards at every entry point to the Pearl, but what they were guarding we could not understand.  Perhaps the empty buildings?There were a lot of shops but of them were covered by big posters stating ""Opens in 1. Quarter 2016"" or ""Opens in Winter 2015/2016). The ones that was opened were empty cafes, realtors and a supermarket. It took about 20 minutes to see it all and then we found a cafe with a few guest where we had something could to drink.

A few years back, the state banned alcohol sales in restaurants in the Pearl complex. I attribute this to the reason for the lack of life in the area. Now, you find many empty shop windows where business has moved elsewhere due to lack of sales. All that is left is a few restaurants and overpriced high-end shops for Saudis (such as Ferrari), which don't fit the expectations of most tourists. Go somewhere else for a walk - like the Corniche. Go somewhere else for shopping - like the Villaggio.The conclusion here is simple: Saudis spend more money here that other (western) tourists and Qatar has repackaged the Pearl in a conservative way accordingly. There is no longer any diversity here, in terms of people or shopping, and I would not recommend this to any tourist visiting the city.",,0
